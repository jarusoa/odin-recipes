    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This coconut curry salmon with broccoli uses Thai red chili paste for beautiful color and depth of flavor. You can make it spicier by using hot curry powder on the filets, and extra red pepper flakes in the sauce. We like this served in a bowl with rice. Use riced cauliflower for an extra serving of veggies, if you prefer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) salmon filets</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons neutral-flavored cooking oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped shallots</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Thai red curry paste, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 can unsweetened full-fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1/2 lime</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped chives or green onions, or to taste (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and brush with 1 tablespoon cooking oil. Preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler.</li>
        <li>Pat salmon filets dry with paper towels and place on the prepared pan, skin side down. Brush filets with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.</li>
        <li>Season filets with curry powder, and season lightly with salt and pepper. Drizzle honey over the filets, and place under the broiler. Broil until just crisp on top, 3 to 5 minutes. Watch carefully; honey may burn easily. Remove from oven and keep warm.</li>
        <li>For coconut curry sauce, melt butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and cook about 1 minute, then add garlic and ginger, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds more,</li>
        <li>Stir in red pepper flakes and Thai red curry paste and cook about 3 minutes. Stir in coconut milk, soy sauce, and fish sauce; bring to a simmer. Add broccoli florets and cook until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add salmon filets to the skillet and simmer until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Squeeze 1/2 lime over the skillet. Garnish with chopped chives or green onions, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
